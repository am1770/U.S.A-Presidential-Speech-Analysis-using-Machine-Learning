# U.S.A-Presidential-Speech-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning
# Overview
This project analyzes inaugural speeches by U.S. Presidents, using NLP and machine learning techniques to study the language, sentiment, and rhetorical style of each speech. Specifically, we examine speeches by:
Franklin D. Roosevelt (1941)
John F. Kennedy (1961)
Richard Nixon (1973)
By processing these texts, we aim to gain insights into each president's unique language and sentiment.

# Project Structure
# Data Extraction
Using the inaugural corpora dataset from NLTK, we load and preprocess speech texts, focusing on word counts, sentence structure, and raw content.

# Text Preprocessing
We apply tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization to standardize the data and prepare it for analysis.

# Feature Engineering
Features include word frequency distributions, sentiment scores, and more complex metrics such as word embeddings.

# Analysis & Visualization
Visual tools like word clouds and sentiment charts compare language patterns and sentiments across speeches.

# Machine Learning Models
Basic models (e.g., Naive Bayes, logistic regression) are applied to classify or cluster speech segments, depending on project goals.
